# Welcome to the Jam

Welcome to the Extra Credits Game Jam everyone! Before anything else, I want
to thank you for so generously giving your time to this project. I am extremely
grateful that you would agree to donate so much of your time and talent for a project
whose only real payoff is fun and the opportunity to try something new!

Below, you will find instructions for setting up your environment so that we are all on
the same page regarding tools and workflow from the get-go!

## Setting Up Git

We will be using `git` for version control (program that tracks file changes and allows
for synchronous collaborative project editing). Please ensure that you have `git` installed
on your computer.

[Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Git is a command-line utility (On Mac OS, open `Terminal`, on Windows, open `Command Prompt`)
but there are also UI-based clients available.  If you are comfortable using the command line,
I highly reccomend it over any GUI tools, however if you want to use a UI, the best bet would
be `GitHub Desktop`.

[Download GitHub Desktop (optional)](https://desktop.github.com/)

[User Guide](https://help.github.com/desktop/)

If you are not familiar with using `git`, please take some time to learn the basics - it will
make things a lot easier! Here is a pretty good [no-frills basics guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

Finally, the project is hosted... right here! On GitHub. You are on the remote repository
right now. You will need to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already. To clone
this project on your machine from the command line:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jhbertra/extra-credits-game-jam.git
```

From the `GitHub Desktop` GUI:

1. Sign in with your GitHub username / password
2. Click `Clone a repository` under `GitHub.com` select `jhbertra/extra-credits-game-jam`
3. Select the folder you want the repository to be cloned into (default is probablly fine).
4. Click `Clone`
5. Click `Initialize Git LFS` when prompted (large file storage used here to improve performance
   when storing Game asset files).
